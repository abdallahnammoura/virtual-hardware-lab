#  Virtual Hardware Lab

This repository documents my self-directed virtual hardware labs using PC Building Simulator and other IT foundation tools.

## What I practiced

- CPU removal and installation
- RAM installation and configuration
- Storage (SSD/HDD) installation
- Power supply connections and cable management
- General troubleshooting and repair workflows

## Documentation

I will include:
- Step-by-step notes (scanned or typed summaries)
- Screenshots of each key step
- My personal "Standard Operating Procedure" (SOP) for future reference

## Why I'm doing this

I am building hands-on skills as a foundation for IT support and cybersecurity analyst roles. Even without access to physical hardware, this approach helps me develop confidence in real-world concepts.
